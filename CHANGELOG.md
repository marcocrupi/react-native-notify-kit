## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **iOS**: Fixed `getInitialNotification()` returning `null` on cold start due to deprecated `UIApplicationLaunchOptionsLocalNotificationKey` check — `_initialNoticationID` was always `nil` on iOS 10+, causing the ID comparison to fail (upstream: [invertase/notifee#1128](https://github.com/invertase/notifee/issues/1128))
- **Android**: Fixed `getInitialNotification()` returning `null` when notification has no `pressAction` configured — `InitialNotificationEvent` sticky event is now posted regardless of `pressAction` presence (upstream: [invertase/notifee#1128](https://github.com/invertase/notifee/issues/1128))
- **Android**: Added event buffering in `NotifeeReactUtils` to prevent foreground press events from being silently dropped when React instance is not yet ready (upstream: [invertase/notifee#1279](https://github.com/invertase/notifee/issues/1279))
- **iOS**: Added `setNotificationConfig({ ios: { handleRemoteNotifications: false } })` opt-out flag to prevent Notifee from intercepting remote notification tap handlers — restores `onNotificationOpenedApp()` and `getInitialNotification()` for React Native Firebase Messaging (upstream: [invertase/notifee#912](https://github.com/invertase/notifee/issues/912))
- **iOS**: Fixed `completionHandler` not being called on notification dismiss path in `didReceiveNotificationResponse:`, preventing potential handler leaks
- **iOS**: Fixed `completionHandler` not being called in `willPresentNotification:` fallback path when no original delegate is available
- **iOS**: Added missing `return` after forwarding to `_originalDelegate` in `didReceiveNotificationResponse:` default path, preventing potential fall-through to `parseUNNotificationRequest`
